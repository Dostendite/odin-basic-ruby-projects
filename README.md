### Problem solving approach

It turns out writing code semi-arbitrarily
and banging my head against the wall is WAY
less efficient, fun or productive than
taking the time to understand the problem,
then making a plan & writing pseudocode to
cleanly implement it, which takes much less
time and is so much easier to do, as well as fun.
